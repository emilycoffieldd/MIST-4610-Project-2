# Dataset Information

Our team set out to use a data file from the US Data gov website (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset). We examined the different datasets and sought out one that we could use to accurately model two questions about American society and culture. These questions would hold some sort of public and predictive significance when modeled. In saying that, we chose a data set that examined the demographics of Americans of people who committed suicide overtime (i.e. race, sex, age, etc.) Some of the important columns to note are the "ESTIMATE", a decimal, column that numbers the persons in a given population of 100,000 who committed suicide, "STUB_NAME_NUM" and "STUB_LABEL_NUM", an integer and a decimal respectively assigned to distinct stubs, which identify the "STUB_LABEL", a varchar data type, column- which is a column that denotes the demographics of the population. "AGE", a range denoted by a varchar, is another important column that denotes the age of the population being monitored and is distinguished by the identifying column "AGE_NUM", a unique decimal assigned to each distinct age range. Finally, "YEAR", a datetime, is possibly our most important column in the set as it distinguishes the year that the measure was collected in. The data set we selected has more than 6000 rows of data as well as 13 columns.

# What We Want to Find Out

Have suicide rates gone up over time?

We wanted to examine the trend of suicide rates overtime. Have they gone up? Are their any points of abrupt uptick? This might highlight some contributing factors. Being able to read the suicide rate trend throughout the years is crucial as it allows one to visit a few concerns and develop suicide prevention strategies. The identification of the abrupt shifts in the trend allows one to revisit the possible contributing factors such as major historical events at the time, economic factors, sex, etc. In addition, the analysis of the contributing factors can lead to interventions for specific populations or the development of new policies.  Furthermore, the advocation for mental health and the increase in community support can be more heavily enforced during times when there are similar contributing factors reappearing in the future. 

What sort of demographic factors impact suicide the most?

When looking at contributing factors to suicide, it might be helpful to examine demographics that are more succeptable to mental health problems. What races struggle more? Does gender play a role? What about ethnicity? Similar to question 1, the analysis and results from question 2 can help with targeted prevention measures and new policy developments. However, it specifically dives into cultural and social sensitivity as it takes into account how different demographic groups can have differing cultural perspectives on suicide, which is a crucial part of the research considering how a lack of cultural sensitivity in the preventive measures can potentially backfire. Furthermore, analyzing different demographic factors and their impact on suicide rates can lead to deeper research into mental health disparities among the different groups as well.

# Analysis and Results

Have suicide rates gone up over time?

Overall, suicide rates for the total population have gone up over time as you can see from the linear trend line. However, there was an abrupt shift in the trend during the year 2000, when it reached its lowest suicide rate. The suicide rate was pretty stable until the year 1986 when the rate went down reaching its lowest in the year 2000 and started steadily rising afterward.
